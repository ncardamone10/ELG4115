* - Please use the global SPICE GP parameter TEMP to specify the
*	junction temperature of the device in your application to get
*	correct simulation results. This procedure is necessary because
*	the GP model does not consider the self heating of the device.
* - TEMP is calculated by TEMP=TA+Pdc*(RthJS+RthSA). The junction
*   temperature TEMP is the sum of the ambient temperature TA and
*   the increment of temperature caused by the dissipated DC power Pdc.
* - RthJS is the thermal resistance between the junction and the
*   soldering point. RthJS for this device is 110 K/W. RthSA is the
*   thermal resistance of the PCB, from the soldering point to the
*   ambient. For determination of RthSA please refer to Infineon's
*   Application Note "Thermal Resistance Calculation" AN077.
* - The model has been verified in the junction temperature range
*   -25°C to +125°C.
* - TNOM=25 °C is the nominal ambient temperature during measurement
*   for the parameter extraction. Please do not change this value.
