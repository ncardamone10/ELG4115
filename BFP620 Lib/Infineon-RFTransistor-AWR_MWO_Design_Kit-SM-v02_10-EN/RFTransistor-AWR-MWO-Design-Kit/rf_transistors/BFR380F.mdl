* - Please use the global SPICE parameter TEMP to set the junction
*   temperature of this device in your circuit to get correct DC
*   simulation results.
* - TEMP is calculated by TEMP=TA+P*(RthJS+RthSA). The junction
*   temperature TEMP is the sum of the ambient temperature TA and
*   the increment of temperature caused by the dissipated power
*   P=VCE*IC (IC collector current, VCE collector-emitter voltage).
* - RthJS is the thermal resistance between the junction and the
*   soldering point. RthJS for this device is 145 K/W. RthSA is the
*   thermal resistance of the PCB, from the soldering point to the
*   ambient. For determination of RthSA please refer to Infineon's
*   Application Note 'Thermal Resistance Calculation' AN077.
* - The model has been verified in the junction temperature range
*   -25°C to +125°C.
* - TNOM=25 °C is the nominal ambient temperature.
*   Please do not change this value.
